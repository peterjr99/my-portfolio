          I began learning to code a few years ago, and ever since then, I've developed an obsession with coding and creating user-friendly websites.Â My projects helped me secure my first web developer internship,  I primarily assisted with the front-end but also contributed a little bit with the Backend. This experience taught me time management skills, teamwork techniques, and new technologies.

          As a Junior Web Developer, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React on the Frontend and Node.js PostgreSQL on the Backend.
           I'm excellent at creating and managing user-friendly, responsive websites. My area of expertise is creating dynamic, 
           captivating interfaces using state-of-the-art development tools and methodologies along with well-written, efficient code.
            Outside of coding, I'm equally passionate about Soccer, Basketball and hanging with family and friends.
